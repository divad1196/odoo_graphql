# README

I am keeping a local version of the libraries for many reason (safety, performance, ...)
I do not own the external libraries. Usage of theses files must respect their original licences.



To retrieve a librarie that is on npm, we can search for their CDN, like

```bash
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/graphiql-explorer/0.9.0/graphiqlExplorer.min.js
```

and download them (e.g. using `wget`)



### GraphiQL Explorer

Based on [this example](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/blob/HEAD/packages/graphiql-plugin-explorer/examples/index.html)
